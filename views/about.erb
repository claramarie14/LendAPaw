      <h1>Adopt Don't Shop</h1>
      <h2>Adopt don't Shop is a motto that truly stands up for what it believes in, adopting loving, caring animals at shelters instead of buying ones from pet stores and puppy mills at ridiculous prices.  5 to 7 million pets enter animal shelters every year, while 3 to 4 million are euthanized.  Each year adoptable dogs and cats are killed in the United States simply because too many pets come into the shelters.  The number of animals being killed could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them.  When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them apart of your family, welcoming them with open arms.</h2>

      <h3>When you adopt:
       <ul>
      <li>You are saving money. The cost of neuter/spay and first vaccinations is included in the adoption price, which can save you some of the up front costs of adding a new member to your family.</li><br>

      <li>You are saving a life.  Once you have a pet purchased from a pet store, you are on your own.  Most pet stores donâ€™t provide any support if you have questions or problems with your new pet. When you adopt you know what you are getting because the group has a history on the animal. </li><br>

      <li>You get just as much love (if not more). An adopted pet is every bit as loving, intelligent and loyal as a purchased pet, even if you get an adult or older animal.</li><br>
